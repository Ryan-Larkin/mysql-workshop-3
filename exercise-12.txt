Connect to your MySQL instance using the root user
Execute this Statement: DROP DATABASE mysql; EXIT;
Execute this Command sudo killall mysqld
Execute this Command mysql-ctl start
OMG!!! Explain what happened.
Find a way to recover the MySQL instance.

We dropped the default mysql database mysql, which holds all the users and privileges.
We then killed the mysqld process, which is the mysql server daemon program, which runs the mysql server

We are now unable to start mysql because we dropped the default table and killed the server process.

To get it all back, we need to start the mysqld process again, and then recreate the default database with 
mysqld --initialize

We can then use mysql-ctl start as normal
